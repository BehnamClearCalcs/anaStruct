Installation
============

You can install anaStruct with pip!

::

    $ pip install anastruct[plot]

Or if you would like a headless version of anaStruct (with no plotting abilities), you can do that too.

::
    
    $ pip install anastruct

Finally, while updates are made regularly on PyPI, if you'd like the bleeding edge newest features and fixes, or if you'd like to contribute to the development of anaStruct, then install from github.

::

    $ pip install git+https://github.com/ritchie46/anaStruct.git
